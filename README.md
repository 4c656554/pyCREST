# pyCREST
A python implementation of the CREST demand model [1][2] - for creating multiple profiles.

The program has been adapted for the creation of a population of demand profiles.

The distribution of household sizes is based on the UK census [3]

The model was also adapted so that it 'pre-runs' for the 198 minutes before minute 0. This is to allow for the potential starting of washing machines and other long cycle appliances during this time.
